Hey there!
This is a repository for our site www.muezza.skinempire.dk. Wanna know the lore (history) of the creation of this project?


- Its a site where admin can list skins (from Counter-Strike 2) - This is 'just' for a project in school, we have no intentions of actually profiting off this site or sell/buy any skins.
- Its a razor pages website
- ..ITS ACTUALLY OUR FIRST (REAL, PUBLISHED, HOSTED) RAZOR PAGE WEBSITE
- We used Scaffold Identity to create the register/login functions - you can also change your email, add phone number and change password (click on 'hi (your email)
- At first, we tried to host our site on Heroku.. didnt work with the database, although it was free. Then, we used Simply.com anddd... IT WORKED.
- Scaffolding Identity took us approx. a whole month. A whole month of trial and error, migrating, ApplicationUser.cs but it was worth it.
- We used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for the database
- Theme is called 'Vapor' from **https://bootswatch.com/vapor/**
